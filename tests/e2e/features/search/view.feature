Feature: View styles (List and Grid)
  In order to gain a better overview of different types of europeana items,
  as a user I want to be able to switch between a list and grid view style when
  on search results pages.

  # TODO: Add back - And I click the `search button` instead of press ENTER

  Scenario: Defaulting to grid view
    When I visit the `search page`
    And I click the `show search button`
    And I press the ENTER key
    Then I see a `item previews grid`

  Scenario: Defaulting to grid view after paginating
    When I visit the `search page`
    And I click the `show search button`
    And I press the ENTER key
    And I go to page number 2
    Then I see a `item previews grid`

  Scenario: Switching to the list view
    When I visit the `search page`
    And I click the `show search button`
    And I press the ENTER key
    And I click the `search list view toggle`
    Then I see a `item previews list`

  Scenario: Switching to the grid view
    When I open `/search?view=list`
    And I click the `search grid view toggle`
    Then I see a `item previews grid`

  Scenario: Switching to the list view and paginating
    When I visit the `search page`
    And I click the `show search button`
    And I press the ENTER key
    And I click the `search list view toggle`
    And I go to page number 2
    Then I see a `item previews list`

  Scenario: The view parameter is preserved and present in the URL for the list view
    Given I have chosen the `list` search results view
    When I visit the `home page`
    And I click the `show search button`
    And I enter "paris" in the `search box`
    And I press the ENTER key
    Then I see a `item previews list`

  Scenario: The view parameter is preserved and present in the URL for the grid view
    Given I have chosen the `grid` search results view
    When I visit the `home page`
    And I click the `show search button`
    And I enter "paris" in the `search box`
    And I press the ENTER key
    Then I see a `item previews grid`

  Scenario: Back button restores previous view
    Given I am on `/search?view=grid`
    When I click the `search list view toggle`
    And I see a `item previews list`
    And I go back
    Then I see a `item previews grid`
